# Introduction
<!-- position: 1 -->

Bludit is a web application to build your own **website** or **blog** in seconds; it's completely **free and open source**. Bludit is a Flat-File CMS, which (in this case) means that Bludit uses files in the **JSON** format to store the content. You don't need to install or configure a database; you only need a web server with PHP support.
